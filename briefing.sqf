<br/>
	What is GoT2DayZ and why are you hosting Arma3?<br/><br/>
	GoT2DayZ was initially founded as a player-base for the dutch Tweakers.NET Community<br/>
	However as time passed on we also started playing wasteland on arma2.<br/>
	Now with arma3 also having wasteland, we run 3 publics and 1 private server.<br/>
	<br/><br/>
	* DayZ Chernarus (Private/Passworded) with safezone<br/>
	* DayZ Celle (Whitelisted)<br/>
	* ArmA2 Wasteland on Utes (Customized by us)<br/>
	* ArmA3 Alpha Wasteland on Stratis (Costomized by us)<br/>
	<br/>
	I cant urge enough that all credits for this mission go to the original makers at 404Games!<br/>
